# awk is a commom commad to classify and help to analyze the data.
# Here I use this to figure out the problem.
# you can use the command to install the awk
# awk can help import the data
# awk --version can check the version of what you use
#awk -F":"NR>=2 && NR<=6{print NR,$1} /etc/passwd
#-F means that point out
# ":" means that chop the line into two parts
#NR>=8 && NR<=15: this part  is a pattern to withdraw the line 2 to lin 6
#NR(number of record 
#$0 it means the whole line or record
#The awk include the [pattern] & [option]

#the fundamental behaviors [pattern][option]
example 1:
	awk -F":"'NR5>=&&NR<=18'{print NR,$1} /etc/passwd

#only the patterns
example 2:
	awk -F":"NR>=2&&NR<=6' /etc/passwd

#you can compare the difference of the example 1 and example 
example 3 :
	awk -F":"{print NR,$1}' /etc/passwd
#the example 3 only have the action


#NR==1 means the condition satisfied
#==================================================#


example 4
#linux will comply some conndition to split the string
echo "a b c d"| awk '{print $2}'


example 5
echo "a b c d" | awk-F'''{for(i=2;i<=NF;i++){printf $i""} printf"\n"}'}
echo "a b c d" | awk '{ print substr($0, index($0, " ") + 1); }'
